Game of Life - Java

An exercise to learn Slick2D and TWL by recreating the Game of Life (Hasbro game).  

I used awesome sprites from this website: http://www.reinerstilesets.de/

Maven Notes:

The TWL and Slick depdencies are not in public Sonus Nexus repository (not that I could find) so I patch them manually in my M2 local.  Check the pom.xml for the detail.
